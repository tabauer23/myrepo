## Keyring Vignette

 ref: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keyring/index.html>

This is a simple walkthrough of how to setup keyring. This is an incredibly useful package, specially if you are trying to remember credentials for use in the EDW/EBI systems (databases), and you are using an API to access the systems within R studio. 

![an image of a DBI connect with prompt](C:/Users/trevor.a.bauer/Pictures/Keyring Presentation/DBI prompt.png)

This image is an example of DBI connection with popups prompting the user to enter their username nad password. This would require you to retrieve your username (often just your windows login name) and your password, sometimes set by the DoIT services, and sometimes set by you. This would require you to have stored, or remember the password. 

You can use a password keep software, like [Keypass 2](https://keepass.info/) (available in the Software center), or some other means of remembering a password, like the sticky notes that we aren't using.

### Keyring package

 **Keyring** allows us to store and retrieve passwords and usernames within an encrypted keypass system within the R studio architecture. It is sometimes (often much more useful) to provide credentials programattically in an R script or environment; specially if we are going to be accessing the same systems repetitively. 
 
 It is important to remember **avoid publishing code with your credentials in plain text**


## Hidden Keyrings

You can also hide local keyrings, for example: 

```{r setting your keyring objects, include=TRUE}

# Set variables to be used in keyring.

#Sets the name of the keyring itself
kr_name <- "example_keyring"
#sets the name of the service used for the keyring below
kr_service <- "database1"
#sets the name of the user used for the keyring below
kr_username <- "trevorb"


```

Any of these variable strings can be changed to incorporate an additional service. e.g. if you have multiple different credentials you want stored, or multiple users within the same keyring. The naming convention for these objects can be whatever you want, assuming you remember what each object is called, most importantly is the keyring name. In this example we can have call the keyring "kr_name"

Each of these objects is important for the keyring: 

In our example: 
kr_name is the string name of the keyring we created, you can think of this like an actual keyring. 
kr_service is the string used as the database you are attempting to access. 
kr_username is the string used as the username of the keyring.

If you wanted to add a new username to the same keyring, you can update the string for the kr_username and kr_service above and rerun the code to save the atomic vectors as the new username. For this example we will use these strings. 

```{r keyring creation, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Create a keyring and add an entry using the variables above
kb <- keyring::backend_file$new()
# Prompt for the keyring password, used to unlock keyring
kb$keyring_create(kr_name)
# Prompt for the credential to be stored in the keyring
kb$set(service="databaseexp", username="trevorb", keyring=kr_name)
# Lock the keyring
kb$keyring_lock(kr_name)

```
Be sure to lock the keyring **after you use it** specially if your R session is going to continue to remain open. This ensures that the key is locked and requires a new password entered if it is to be used again. 


### Retreieve username and password from "hidden" keyrings

It is possible to retrieve passwords from hidden keys assuming you know the username, service name, and the keyring name/password. You would need to (assuming the keyring was not already unlocked) present the password when you first unlock or attempt to retrieve passwords for a hidden keyring.

```{r pressure, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# retrieve username and password, though usually you would never want to do this, but it is possible to get the username and password.
keyring::backend_file$new()$get(service = "databaseexp",
                                user = "trevorb",
                                keyring = kr_name)

```

 If we would like to list the keyrings and their associated number of "keys" or passwords in them we can use the command keyring_list()
 
```{r}

keyring_list()

```

Notice here we do not see the keyring "kr_name" because this has been created as a backend file, hiding the keyring from the list here. In order to see this keyring we would need to call it explictly 


In an above chunk we created a new backend file "kb" which is a keyring environment that is hidden from the default keyring system. If we want to see the keyrings within this environment we can list them like so: 
```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}

kb$keyring_list()

```
